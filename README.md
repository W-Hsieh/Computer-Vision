# Computer Vision: Totally-Looks-Like (TLL) image matching

# Abstract
This project addresses the challenge of Totally-Looks-Like image matching. To achieve this, we utilize feature extraction methods based on pre-trained CNN models, including VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet. The following model training is carried out using Siamese networks.
